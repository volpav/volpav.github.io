                    I'm a software engineer with more than 14 years of professional experience. I've been working on products, ranging from small single-page applications to mid-size content management, eCommerce and online marketing systems to large general-purpose cloud platforms and analytical software for some of the largest financial institutions in the world. I have also a successful track record when it comes to leading and managing a team, including both technical leadership, process management and delivery as well as people management.

                        "Pavel and I have over the years been working together on numerous software projects being on the same development team where I've had the position both as Pavel's co-worker but also as his manager. Pavel is an outstanding software developer and always creates new functionality of the highest quality. He also has a very rare ability to crunch even the most troublesome bugs and problems. You can always rely on Pavel and you are always certain that he'll do his best to achieve the goals that have been set. When approaching Pavel with a new idea or project you can always be sure that he will provide you with well reasoned arguments and feedback that can open a discussion and eventually take the project in a more prosperous direction. Finally Pavel also has a rare gift of being able to communicate extremely well both to his peers but also to people without the same level of technical insight."
